title: Local dependency support
desc: |-
  Sinan doesn't yet handle cross project dependencies. ie, if you
  have 2 projects you are working on and one depends on the other there
  isn't really any way to tell that to sinan. It always looks to the
  current project or the remote repository for dependencies. It needs to
  be able to look to a local project or even a local on-disc repository.
